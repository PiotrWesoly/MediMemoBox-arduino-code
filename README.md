  One of the key features of our application is a built-in schedule with a calendar. In this calendar, one can add events such as: “take medicine”, where one states what is the name of the medicine, what kind of medicine it is and how frequently one has to take it, a medical appointment, where one can write the name of a doctor and the details about the appointment, or a different event. The added event will be displayed in the calendar so one can browse through them. The application will remind about them with notification. After the reminder goes off, the customer can state whether they took the medicine. This information is stored by the application. Customers can also choose to postpone an event if needed. Another feature of the application is a reward system. It will help the customers stay motivated. The customer can complete an achievement by attaining a specific goal. In the progress section, there is one general progress bar, displaying the overall progress, and some minor progress bars, that show the progress with individual activities.

  The second part of our idea, the “MemoBox”, is a box for storing smaller medications. Its com- partments are resizable, the box is equipped with a power button and a buzzer. It also has a volume knob. It is not big, so it can be moved around easily. The top layer is removable, it can be easily taken out and cleaned. The box will be connected with the mobile application and, when it’s time to take the medication, the box will make a sound alarm. To prevent people from taking the medicine from the incorrect compartment, we installed LEDs indicating the correct compartment. The box is powered by a 9 V battery, the battery can be easily replaced.

There is also a youtube video which shows how the application and box are working:
